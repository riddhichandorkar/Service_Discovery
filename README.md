This project showcases vehicle data exchange between a producer and consumer using the SOME/IP protocol. The producer sends vehicle parameters like speed, RPM, and temperature, while the consumer decodes and displays them. It simulates ECU communication via vsomeip, demonstrating real-time automotive middleware interaction.
